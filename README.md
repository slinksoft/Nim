# Nim
A representation of a version of the game of Nim.

This is the last assignment that I completed before dropping my COP 3337 class (Programming 2) with Gregory Shaw @ FIU. My reason for dropping his class (among half of the class that did drop) is his unfair and vague midterm test and student graders. His teaching style (literally reading off Microsoft 1998 word documents) is obselete in my opinion, yet I still picked up every topic he was teaching (since I've been programming for years, even before I started college). Dropping the class has delayed my by a minimum of a semester (it might even be 2 semesters), so I cannot forgive him or the head of the CS department for this. According to students across campus, students have been complaining nonstop about programming 2 and 3 since last semester, making this the second semester in a row that FIU's CS department is having issues and facing corruption. I and other students are doing out best to fight for academic fairness within the CS department. Time will tell what the solution may be.

Anyways, this project is a version of the game called Nim. The project implements interfaces and uses polymorphism techniques to allow "software  extensibility", as Shaw calls it.

Features:
- 3 types of players: Human players, Non-smart computer, smart computer
- Play as many times as you want
- Game starts with a random amount of marbles

That is pretty much it. The purpose of posting this project is to allow others to see how interfaces and polymorphism works to allow "software extensibility". Inerfaces and polymorphism are both very useful in designing software when using classes that contain similar methods.
